        "Credit Card Fraud Detection using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML¶In this exercise session you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. You will use a real dataset to train each of these models. The dataset includes information about\n",
        "transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. You will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.\n",

        "In the current exercise session, you will practice not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface, but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy.
